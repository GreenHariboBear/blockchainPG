# Simple Math Smart Contract
## How to setup the contract
Follow the steps, denoted in the README in folder "Scripts"

## Brief Content of this smart contract
### Purpose
You can pass an input to the contract. The included functions then can compute the result which is `result = input^2+1`

### Functions
setResult(inputvalue): Does the computation itself. No Output to the console. Writes the result to the public variable which then can be accessed by everyone.

outputResult(inputvalue): Shows the result of the computation in the console BUT no writing to the public variable -> result cannot be accessed by other nodes.

result(): Outputs the current value of the computation result on the console.
